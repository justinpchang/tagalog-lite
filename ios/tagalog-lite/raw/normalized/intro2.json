Many people, myself included, like to methodically work their way through an entire textbook. But I have found that if I stop there, even though I am doing other language learning activities simultaneously, my retention is limited. Some people will just live with the results and hope the grammar will come back to them. Others will immediately start another beginner textbook. But I recommend you make additional passes through the same course, like I do. If you keep doing this, you will soon only need to hit the Sample Sentences to adequately review a grammar point. Think of how good your grammar will be when you get to the point where you are only hitting the Sample Sentences, and you can easily cover multiple lessons a day! I think you will agree that this result is far superior to only making a single pass through the course."

Revisit them to sharpen your grammar skills, but when you do, only do the sample sentences and see if you can glean the grammar from that activity alone. If not, do the rest of the lesson too. Eventually you will get to the point where all you will need to do for a refresher is to review the Sample Sentences."
