At the end of each lesson, there are 10 Sample Sentences and a link to the Drills. For at least 10 minutes per day, listen to the audio of some of these sentences and repeat, trying to sound just like the audio. And that means not only hitting the right vowels and consonants, but also having the right stress, glottal stops and prosody. Take special care with your _k, p, t _and _o_’s. I encourage you to keep doing this practice until you feel you are pronouncing the sentences almost perfectly. This may take several weeks for beginners, but it is well worth it."
