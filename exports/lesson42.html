<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Although all of the underlined items above are adverbs, some constructions are non-adverbs in different situations. For example, <em>sa Manila</em> in <em>Maganda ang bahay sa Manila</em> is an adjective because it modifies a noun.</p>
<h3><ins>Rules for using new Adverbs</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Although the definition of adverbs is wide, if you know these two things you will be able to correctly use new ones that you encounter in the wild:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Position</strong>. Adverbs can be enclitic, moveable, initial, or sentence final.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Particle</strong>. It might take no particle. It might take <em>sa </em>before it, <em>sa </em>after it, might need a linker, <em>nang, nung</em>, etc. It might work with multiple particles.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What follows are some examples of adverb usage.</p>
<h3><ins>Time Adverbs</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Time adverbs are moveable:</p>
