<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*You are already familiar with these particles; I listed them all together because this is the order they appear in the enclitic cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">**No need to memorize.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Earlier in the book you were given an introduction to enclitics, and told that eventually there would be a lesson that covers them more thoroughly. This is that lesson. First read <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/216/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix J</strong></a>, which contains a re-cap and general information about all enclitics. Although there are 21 enclitic particles in all, we are only going to use the nine listed above, the most common ones, in enclitic clusters from here on. Two more will be introduced later. That should get you used to them without overwhelming you. After that, you should be able to pick up new ones when you encounter them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this lesson we will introduce <em>pa, din/rin</em> and <em>lang</em>. <em>Nga, po</em> and <em>ba </em>were covered sufficiently in previous lessons, but additional information for <em>na </em>and <em>naman </em>is given below. Finally, you will practice building sentences with all nine.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">One thing you will notice below is that there are often multiple translations for each enclitic particle, and combinations may lead to unexpected results. The definitions given in the vocabulary list above are overly simplified – they are just there as memory hooks.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><ins>Na and Pa</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Na </em>and <em>pa </em>are related, and they both indicate that the sentence contains new information. But <em>na </em>indicates information that is completely new, while <em>pa </em>indicates new information that continues from previous events.</p>

<h3><ins>Some Enclitic Particles can give sentences multiple Meanings.</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Most enclitic particles apply to the entire clause, but <em>din/rin, lang </em>and<em> naman</em>(contrast) do not, which may make you wonder what a sentence actually means. Let’s take:</p>

<div class="d-inline-flex w-100 align-items-center bg-white border-success px-2">

                        <i class="fas fa-volume-up text-powderblue play-example-btn" data-example="34"></i>
                    </button>
                </div>
                <div id="example-34" class="example clickable no-margin-bottom w-50" data-example="34"><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: Nag-aral rin siya ng Tagalog.</p>
</div>
                <button id="example-show-34" class="example-show d-none btn btn-link py-1 px-0 w-50" data-example="34">Show</button>

            </div>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Does this mean “she studied and listened to it” (applied to verb), “she studied Tagalog and French” (applied to the object) or “she and her friend studied Tagalog” (applied to the focus)? It turns out the first two interpretations are ok, but not the third. In this book we call these “focus sensitive” enclitic particles, and they do not apply to the focus of standard sentences. Here are a couple more examples:</p>

            </div>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“Only” does not apply to “door” here. For example, this can mean they are only opening it and not slamming it, or only they are opening it and not Joe, but it cannot mean only the door and not the window.</p>

            </div>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“In contrast” does not apply to “students” here. For example, this can mean in contrast to singing with them, she will teach them, or in contrast to Joshua, Vanessa will teach them. But it cannot mean in contrast to the parents she will teach the students.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Notice that if you emphasize the focus while reading the English sentences above, it seems like “also/only/in contrast” should apply to the focus. But it does not. This is an example of how focus differs from emphasis. We will discuss ways to apply these enclitic particles to focuses in a later lesson.</p>

book you were given an introduction to enclitics, and told that eventually there would be a lesson that covers them more thoroughly. This is that lesson. First read \u003ca href\u003d\"https://languagecrush.com/book/3/216/chapter\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAppendix J\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which contains a re-cap and general information about all enclitics. Although there are 21 enclitic particles in all, we are only going to use the nine listed above, the most common ones, in enclitic clusters from here on. Two more will be introduced later. That should get you used to them without overwhelming you. After that, you should be able to pick up new ones when you encounter them.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003eIn this lesson we will introduce \u003cem\u003epa, din/rin\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003elang\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eNga, po\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eba \u003c/em\u003ewere covered sufficiently in previous lessons, but additional information for \u003cem\u003ena \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003enaman \u003c/em\u003eis given below. Finally, you will practice building sentences with all nine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003eOne thing you will notice below is that there are often multiple translations for each enclitic particle, and combinations may lead to unexpected results. The definitions given in the vocabulary list above are overly simplified – they are just there as memory hooks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cins\u003eNa and Pa\u003c/ins\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003e\u003cem\u003eNa \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003epa \u003c/em\u003eare related, and they both indicate that the sentence contains new information. But \u003cem\u003ena \u003c/em\u003eindicates information that is completely new, while \u003cem\u003epa \u003c/em\u003eindicates new information that continues from previous events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"d-inline-flex w-100 align-items-center bg-white border-success px-2\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                    \u003caudio id\u003d\"sound-example-9\"\u003e\n                \u003csource src\u003d\"/api/v1/blob/book/f8774774-0cdb-4aa7-90bf-9946ab1e8713/ORIGINAL/audio.mp3\" type\u003d\"audio/mpeg\"\u003e\n                \u003csource src\u003d\"/api/v1/blob/book/f8774774-0cdb-4aa7-90bf-9946ab1e8713/ORIGINAL/audio.mp4\" type\u003d\"audio/mp4\"\u003e\n                Your browser does not support the audio element.\n            \u003c/audio\u003e \n                    \u003cbutton class\u003d\"btn btn-link py-0 play-example-btn\" data-example\u003d\"9\"\u003e\n                        \u003ci class\u003d\"fas fa-volume-up text-powderblue play-example-btn\" data-example\u003d\"9\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n                    \u003c/button\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv id\u003d\"example-9\" class\u003d\"example clickable no-margin-bottom w-50\" data-example\u003d\"9\"\u003e\u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003eEx: Guro na siya. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cbutton id\u003d\"example-show-9\" class\u003d\"example-show d-none btn btn-link py-1 px-0 w-50\" data-example\u003d\"9\"\u003eShow\u003c/button\u003e\n                \n                \u003cdiv id\u003d\"example-answer-9\" class\u003d\"example-answer clickable no-margin-bottom w-100\" data-example\u003d\"9\"\u003e\n                    \u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003e\u003d She is a teacher now.
