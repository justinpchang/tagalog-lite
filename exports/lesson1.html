<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My goal here is not to give a written description of all aspects of Tagalog pronunciation – that would fill too many pages. Instead, I will give you the basics and ask you to rely heavily on listening to audio and repeating as described below.</p>
<br>
<h1>How to do this lesson</h1>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">While reading through this lesson you will encounter 
Tagalog words with audio that are used to demonstrate certain aspects of
 pronunciation. As you go along, listen to the audio and repeat. Do one 
enough times to feel you are pronouncing it correctly, then move onto 
the next one. The English translations are for reference only; there is 
no need to memorize vocabulary at this point.</li>
<li dir="auto">After going through the whole lesson, go through it 
again, this time without reading any descriptions. Hide the English, 
look at the first Tagalog word, pronounce it, then listen to the audio. 
If your pronunciation is correct, go onto the next word. If not, keep 
doing it until you feel that you are pronouncing it correctly, then move
 on.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="auto">Repeat the previous step until you feel that you are pronouncing them all correctly the first time with ease.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #ff8748;">Stress</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In a Tagalog word, a stressed vowel is one that is pronounced longer or louder than non-stressed vowels. In most cases, the stress is on the second to last vowel. Stress is not marked in normal writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In some learning materials, stress is marked to demonstrate the correct pronunciation of a word. In this book, we use the official system for denoting stress (and glottal stops) the first time you encounter a word. <strong>Stress is not marked on single syllable words. Stress is not marked if it occurs on the second-to-last vowel. Stress is marked with an acute accent mark (á) if it occurs in other locations</strong> (when there is no glottal stop).&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff8748;">Glottal Stop</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When there is a glottal stop, the sound is somewhat shorter and ends abruptly, like in English after the “uh” in the exclamation “uh-oh”. There are three places where glottal stops occur that you should be aware of.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First, sometimes they occur after the <strong>last letter of a word if the word ends in a vowel</strong>. These are not marked in normal writing. We are using the official system, so the first time you encounter a word in this book, <strong>a glottal stop will be marked with a grave accent mark (à) if the vowel is unstressed, and a circumflex accent mark (â) if the vowel is stressed</strong>:</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">* <em>k, p</em> and <em>t</em> are not aspirated in Tagalog, meaning you do not release a little puff of air when you pronounce them like you do in English.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">** <em>o</em> is shorter in Tagalog than English. If you start to pronounce <em>o</em> in English, but stop half-way through, it will sound like the Tagalog <em>o</em>.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*** <em>r</em> has no equivalent sound in English, but it is the same as the Spanish soft “r”. It sounds a bit like the “dd” in ladder.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Variations – when<em> i </em>comes at the end of a word, it can be pronounced more like a Tagalog <em>e; k</em> can sound like the “ch” in “loch” when surrounded by vowels.</li>
<li dir="auto">Loan letters <em>c, f, j, q, v, x, z</em> sometimes 
appear, and they are normally pronounced the same as their English 
counterparts. But not always – for exceptions, see the section on 
Spanish Words below.&nbsp;</li>

<li dir="auto">Variations – <em>diy, niy</em> and <em>siy</em> can also be pronounced as their individual letters (meaning the <em>i</em> gets pronounced), or somewhere in between. For example, <em>diyes</em> can be pronounced as “jes”, “di-yes” or “jyes”.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><span style="color: #ff8748;">Spanish Spelling</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Many Tagalog words come from Spanish, and most are spelled in Tagalog. Although Tagalog spelling is always possible, some words normally retain their Spanish spelling. These words are mostly proper nouns, but there are a few exceptions, such as <em>lechon</em>. Most are pronounced the same as their Spanish counterparts, but notice that the Spanish “ll”, which sounds like the “y” in “yes” in English, is pronounced <em>ly</em> in Tagalog. Also, “z”, which sounds like “s” in “so” in English, is normally pronounced <em>z</em> in Tagalog.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff8748;">Sentence-level pronunciation.</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This lesson has covered pronunciation from single sounds up to entire words. After mastering that, the next step is to practice sentence-level pronunciation. At the end of each lesson, there are 10 Sample Sentences and a link to the Drills. For at least 10 minutes per day, listen to the audio of some of these sentences and repeat, trying to sound just like the audio. And that means not only hitting the right vowels and consonants, but also having the right stress, glottal stops and prosody. Take special care with your <em>k, p, t</em> and <em>o</em>’s.  I encourage you to keep doing this practice until you feel you are pronouncing the sentences almost perfectly. This may take several weeks for beginners, but it is well worth it.</p>

Stress is marked with an acute accent mark (á) if it occurs in other locations (when there is no glottal stop). \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"offset\":215,\"length\":188,\"style\":\"BOLD\"}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"e5jrm\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"6rhq6\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":1,\"key\":0}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"btjd6\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"4jatc\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"dogp1\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":1,\"key\":1}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ai9pa\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"f7rm8\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"5ivfv\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":1,\"key\":2}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"c3kal\",\"text\":\"Using the correct stress is very important because incorrect stress may confuse native speakers, and sometimes change the meaning of the word:\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"f8pm5\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"cg3d5\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":1,\"key\":3}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"kbmb\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"36brb\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"8g1bg\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"atomic\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":1,\"key\":4}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"9q2ai\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"5qa90\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"57lmq\",\"text\":\"Glottal Stop\",\"type\":\"header-two\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"offset\":0,\"length\":12,\"style\":\"color-#ff8748\"}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"90ico\",\"text\":\"When there is a glottal stop, the sound is somewhat shorter and ends abruptly, like in English after the “uh” in the exclamation “uh-oh”.

And that means not only hitting the right vowels and consonants, but also having the right stress, glottal stops and prosody. Take special care with your k, p, t and o’s.  I encourage you to keep doing this practice until you feel you are pronouncing the sentences almost perfectly. This may take several weeks for beginners, but it is well worth it.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"offset\":524,\"length\":7,\"style\":\"ITALIC\"},{\"offset\":536,\"length\":1,\"style\":\"ITALIC\"}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"54gnm\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{\"0\":{\"type\":\"EXAMPLE\",\"mutability\":\"IMMUTABLE\",\"data\":{\"question\":\"\u003cp\u003esa\u003c/p\u003e\\n\",\"answer\":\"\u003cp\u003e(at)

Although Tagalog spelling is always possible, some words normally retain their Spanish spelling. These words are mostly proper nouns, but there are a few exceptions, such as \u003cem\u003elechon\u003c/em\u003e. Most are pronounced the same as their Spanish counterparts, but notice that the Spanish “ll”, which sounds like the “y” in “yes” in English, is pronounced \u003cem\u003ely\u003c/em\u003e in Tagalog.

After mastering that, the next step is to practice sentence-level pronunciation. At the end of each lesson, there are 10 Sample Sentences and a link to the Drills. For at least 10 minutes per day, listen to the audio of some of these sentences and repeat, trying to sound just like the audio. And that means not only hitting the right vowels and consonants, but also having the right stress, glottal stops and prosody. Take special care with your \u003cem\u003ek, p, t\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eo\u003c/em\u003e’s.  I encourage you to keep doing this practice until you feel you are pronouncing the sentences almost perfectly. This may take several weeks for beginners, but it is well worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","enabled":true,"overrided":false},"websocketUrl":"wss://api.languagecrush.com/api/v1/pushws/connect","notifications":{"keys":[],"byKey":{}},"rooms":{"keys":[],"byKey":{}},"participants":{"keys":[],"byKey":{}},"userPresence":{"keys":[],"byKey":{}},"userPresenceMeta":{"keys":[],"byKey":{}}};
