<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this lesson, we will begin to discuss telling time, and we will finish it in the next lesson. If you do not know the cardinal numbers borrowed from Spanish, please go to <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/210/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix D</strong></a> and memorize them now. Also, if you are not familiar with the hours and days, which are also borrowed from Spanish, go to <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/211/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix E</strong></a> at this time and make a first pass at memorizing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It is possible to tell time with all three numbering systems in Tagalog. It is not very common with pure Tagalog numbers, and we are not here to learn English, so we use the Tagalog version of Spanish numbers to tell time in this book. This is how you ask the time:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">Anong <strong>oras</strong> na? (Tag.) = What time is it? (Eng.)</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Notice that <em>ano </em>takes a linker, changing it to <em>anong</em>, in this sentence. And this is how you answer it:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;"><strong>Hr</strong> + na. (Tag.) = Hr o’clock./It is hr o’clock./It is hour o’clock already. (Eng.)</span></h2>
<h5><strong>Note: “Hr” stands for “hour of day” from this point on. For example, </strong><strong><em>alas-singko</em></strong><strong> in Tagalog or “five” in English. See </strong><a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/220/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix N</strong></a><strong> for all abbreviations used in Structure Equations. </strong></h5>

<h3><ins>Approximately</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You have seen <em>mga </em>used to make things plural, but it can also be used to add the nuance of approximately with a time. It goes in front of the hour.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">mga + hr (Tag.) = about hr o’clock (Eng.)</span></h2>
<h5><strong>Note: The word </strong><strong><em>mga </em></strong><strong>can be a plural indicator, or it can mean “approximately”, depending on the context, but it is always pronounced </strong><strong><em>mangá </em></strong><strong>as mentioned in the pronunciation lesson.</strong></h5>

<h3><ins>Half Past</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Just like in English, you can choose to say “five thirty” or “half past five” in Tagalog. We will use <em>y medya</em>, which is borrowed from Spanish, to mean “half past”:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">hr + y medya (Tag.) = half past hr (Eng.)</span></h2>
