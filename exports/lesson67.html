<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">**You have seen this word before.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The noun affixes that you learned in the previous lesson provide a clear clue as to the nuance or meaning of a noun. In this lesson we will cover the most common noun affixes which do not provide a clue, or which have so many possible clues that it is probably not worth trying to remember them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You may be wondering why there is a lesson on these, since we are just treating them like vocabulary items with no special grammar. I want you to be aware that roots with these affixes are often nouns. If you know this fact, it may improve your ability to recognize them. For example, when I found out <em>ka-...-an</em> was a noun affix, it made nouns like <em>kabataan </em>much easier to recognize and recall. It is just <em>bata </em>(kid) with a <em>ka-...-an</em> affix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You have probably noticed by now that some noun affixes are the same as verb affixes. In earlier lessons, we learned that verbs can often be used as nouns. Having the same affixes is yet another example of the overlap between verbs and nouns in Tagalog.</p>
<h3><ins>Ka-...-an Nouns</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ka + ibig (love) + an = kaibigan = friend</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ka + dami (many) + han = karamihan = majority; most</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ka + bata (kid) + an = kabataan = youth</p>
<h3><ins>-An Nouns</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*liwas (plaza) + an = liwasan = park</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">laro (play) + an = laruan = toy</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">usap (discuss) + an = usapan = discussion</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">* <em>Liwas </em>is archaic but <em>liwasan </em>is not.</p>
<h3><ins>Pa- Nouns</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">pa + ngalan (name) = pangalan = name</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">pa + daan (means) = paraan = method</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*pa + labas (outside) = palabas = show</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*Notice that sometimes there is no obvious connection between the meanings of the root and the word.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><ins>-In Nouns</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">tanaw (scene) + in = tanawin = scenery</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">aral (study) + in = aralin = lesson</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">hangad (purpose) + in = hangarin = desire</p>

affixes that you learned in the previous lesson provide a clear clue as to the nuance or meaning of a noun.

I want you to be aware that roots with these affixes are often nouns. If you know this fact, it may improve your ability to recognize them. For example, when I found out \u003cem\u003eka-...-an\u003c/em\u003e was a noun affix, it made nouns like \u003cem\u003ekabataan \u003c/em\u003emuch easier to recognize and recall. It is just \u003cem\u003ebata \u003c/em\u003e(kid) with a \u003cem\u003eka-...-an\u003c/em\u003e affix.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\u0027white-space: pre-wrap;\u0027\u003eYou have probably noticed by now that some noun affixes are the same as verb affixes.
