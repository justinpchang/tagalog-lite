<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All of these verbs are DF. Using <em>bigyan </em>as an example, when you encounter DF verbs it is recommended that you memorize:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">bigyán = to give something to someone</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because that “something to someone” is a reminder that there is an object and IO. Or you could memorize:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">bigyán = to give, DF</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Or even more if you want:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">bigyán = to give something to someone, DF(DO), root = bigay</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because if you only memorize “to give”, you may not remember that it is DF.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This lesson covers DF -<em>an </em>verbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Traits of DF -<em>an </em>verbs</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">•	DF -<em>an </em>verbs are either DF(DO) or DF(D) (directional focus double object or directional).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">•	DF(DO) means attention is drawn to the IO and it takes <em>ang </em>form.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">•	DF(D) means attention is drawn to the directional complement (dc), and it takes <em>ang </em>form.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">•	They often have the nuance of doing something in the direction of something.</p>
<h3><ins>DF(DO) – Double Object DF Verbs</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you recall:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Standard Sentence(DO) = Verb + Actor + Object + IO</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We can tailor that to DF verbs:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">Standard Sentence(DF(DO)) = <strong>Verb </strong>+ Actor + Object + IO  </span></h2>
<h5><strong>Notes: Actor takes </strong><strong><em>ng </em></strong><strong>form, object takes </strong><strong><em>ng </em></strong><strong>form and IO takes </strong><strong><em>ang </em></strong><strong>form. For imperative, verb takes infinitive, actor is either </strong><strong><em>mo, ninyo</em></strong><strong> or </strong><strong><em>natin</em></strong><strong>. </strong></h5>
