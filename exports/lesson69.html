<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Assuming you know the vocabulary and are comfortable with the speed of conversation, the grammar in this book will allow you to understand most of what you encounter in the wild. That being said, there are some frequently used colloquial phrases that have low frequency grammar. I have included some of the most common ones here. It is best just to memorize these, then do the sample sentences.</p>
<h3><ins>Ibig Sabihin</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As was mentioned in an earlier lesson, <em>ibig </em>is a pseudo verb which is often interchangeable with <em>gusto</em>, but less common. On the other hand, this phrase is very common.</p>

<h3><ins>Pala</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Combinations of enclitic particles can often be difficult to figure out just by combining their individual meanings. <em>Pala </em>is an enclitic particle that means “surprisingly” or “after all”, and often appears in the center of confusing enclitic clusters. Here are some examples.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><ins>Akala</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Akala </em>is a noun that roughly means “mistakenly thought”, and is used in a way similar to <em>alam ko</em>. I include it here because in English we just use the word “thought”, and let stress indicate whether or not it was mistaken.</p>
