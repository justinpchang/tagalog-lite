<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Phrases are groups of two or more words. They may act as, and be substituted for, a specific kind of word in a sentence. For example, noun phrases act as nouns and can be substituted for nouns in a sentence. Adverb phrases act as adverbs, and can be substituted for adverbs in a sentence, etc.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this lesson, we will show possession using <em>ng </em>form and <em>sa </em>form phrases. If you do not know them, or need a refresher, please go to <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/207/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix A</strong></a> and memorize <em>ng </em>form noun markers, <em>ng </em>form personal pronouns and <em>sa </em>form personal pronouns before attempting this lesson.</p>
<h3><ins>Possessive Phrases using ng form</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">These are of the form “noun of noun”; <em>ng </em>means something like “of” in this construction.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">possession + possessor (Tag.) = possessor’s possession (Eng.)</span></h2>
<h5><strong>Note: Possessor takes </strong><strong><em>ng </em></strong><strong>form.</strong></h5>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Warning: <em>sa </em>possessive phrases are much less common than <em>ng</em>, so your goal should be to recognize and understand these when you encounter them, but I recommend you do not use these in colloquial speech when starting out. You will not be wrong or misunderstood if you do, but you will not be talking like a native if you frequently use these. And because native English speakers often find these easier to produce due to their English-like “Possessor’s Possession” structure, there is a great temptation to do just that. So to discourage that habit, I will limit their use to this lesson.</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: magandang manok ko = my beautiful chicken</p>

<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">adj + pp + linker + possession (Tag.) = possessor adj possession (Eng.)</span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Note: Pp takes <em>ng </em>form.</p>

your goal should be to recognize and understand these when you encounter them, but I recommend you do not use these in colloquial speech when starting out. You will not be wrong or misunderstood if you do, but you will not be talking like a native if you frequently use these. And because native English speakers often find these easier to produce due to their English-like “Possessor’s Possession” structure, there is a great temptation to do just that.
