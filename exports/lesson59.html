<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As discussed in <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/209/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix C</strong></a>, some nouns are formed by adding affixes to roots. If you do this with the prefix <em>pag</em>-, it creates a gerund, or a noun in the “-ing” form (eating, making, sleeping, etc.). Use these where a noun would be used in English, but not where a verb would be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mahilig ako sa <ins>pagluluto</ins>. = I like <ins>cooking</ins>. “Cooking” is being used as a noun here, so a <em>pag</em>- noun is used in Tagalog.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><ins>Nagluluto</ins> ako. = I am <ins>cooking</ins>. “Cooking” is being used as a verb here, so a <em>pag</em>- noun is not used in Tagalog.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are three variations of <em>pag</em>- nouns:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Variation 1: pag + kuha = pagkuha = pag + root</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Variation 2: pag + la + lagay = paglalagay = pag + first syllable of root + root</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Variation 3: pag+ ka + tuto = pagkatuto = pag + ka + root</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In theory, the variation required depends on the affix of the verb you are making a gerund for. However, there are many rules and exceptions, so you are probably better off just memorizing complete <em>pag</em>- nouns as you encounter them. The sample sentences will only contain ones from the vocabulary list above.</p>
