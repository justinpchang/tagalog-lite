<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">*<em>Lagyan </em>and <em>puntahan </em>are DF verbs and are included in this lesson for demonstration only.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Using <em>subukan </em>as an example, when you encounter OF verbs it is recommended that you memorize:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">subukan = to try something</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because that “something” is a reminder that there is an object. Or you could memorize:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">subukan = to try, OF</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Or even more if you want:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">subukan = to try something, OF(O), root = subok</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because if you only memorize “to try”, you may not remember that it is OF.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this lesson, we introduce -<em>an </em>verbs, another member of the Big Six. They can be AF, OF or DF, but AF -<em>an </em>verbs are pretty rare, so we will not cover them. Please memorize the <em>ng </em>form demonstrative pronouns in <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/207/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix A</strong></a>. You may want to review <a href="https://languagecrush.com/book/3/213/chapter" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix G</strong></a> at this point if you need a refresher on focus. Other than discussing infinitive and aspect, which apply to all -<em>an </em>verbs, this lesson will cover OF -<em>an </em>verbs. Next lesson will cover DF -<em>an </em>verbs.</p>
<h3><ins>Traits of OF -an verbs</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">•	All OF -<em>an </em>verbs are OF(O) (object focus single object). OF means attention is drawn to the object and it takes <em>ang </em>form.</p>
<h3><ins>Infinitive*</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All -<ins>an </ins>verbs end with -<em>an</em>. Unfortunately, deriving the infinitive from the root is not usually as easy as adding -<em>an </em>to it. That is why I recommend memorizing the infinitive and generic root. These are sufficient to derive all the aspects.</p>
<h3><ins>*Extra – Deriving the Infinitive</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Alternatively, you could memorize rules like "if the root ends in a consonant or glottal stop, you add -<em>an</em>, otherwise add -<em>han</em>" and "when you add a suffix to a root that has an <em>o </em>in the final syllable, the <em>o </em>usually morphs to a <em>u</em>". These work sometimes:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: subók =&gt; subukan (-<em>an </em>is added since <em>subok</em> ends in a consonant, and the <em>o </em>morphs into a <em>u </em>since the final syllable of <em>subok </em>contains an <em>o</em>)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: hayà =&gt; hayaan (-<em>an </em>is added since <em>hayá </em>ends in a glottal stop)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: abáng =&gt; abangán (-<em>an </em>is added since <em>abang </em>ends in a consonant)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: puntá =&gt; puntahán (-<em>han </em>is added since <em>punta </em>ends in a vowel without a glottal stop)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But notice that these verbs do not follow those rules:</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: bukás =&gt; buksán		(<em>a </em>is shifted after the <em>s </em>and <em>n </em>is added)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: simulâ =&gt; simulán	(<em>n </em>is added)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ex: lagáy =&gt; lagyán		(<em>a </em>is shifted after the <em>y </em>and <em>n </em>is added)</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition, the rules do not predict stress, even of the verbs that “work”. You can probably see now why I recommend that you memorize, rather than derive, the infinitive.</p>
<h3><ins>Completed Aspect</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Add <em>in </em>before the first vowel of the infinitive (see <em>mag</em>- verbs for stress patterns).</p>

<h3><ins>Change of Word Order due to Enclitics</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The verb in the standard sentence structure equation is bold, meaning it is the host for enclitics. It turns out that <em>ng </em>personal pronouns (pps), or <em>kita</em>, come before <em>ang </em>pps in the enclitic cluster, so let’s update the definition:</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">enclitic cluster = (one-syllable pps) +
 (enclitic particles) + (ng form two-syllable pps or kita) + (ang form 
two-syllable pps)  </span></h2>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As long as you stick to the standard order (verb, actor, object), <em>ng </em>pps coming before <em>ang </em>pps will not affect word order.</p>
