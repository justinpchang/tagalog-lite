<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About plain pseudo-verbs: although I listed seven words above, we will not use <em>maaari </em>because it means the same as <em>puwede </em>but is less common. We will not use <em>dapat</em> because it is similar in meaning to <em>ng </em>pseudo-verb <em>kailangan </em>but less common. <em>Meron </em>has already been covered. We used <em>mahilig </em>to like a noun in general. But it is not a pseudo-verb, and it is more common to use ng pseudo-verb <em>gusto </em>to like a verb, so we do not cover <em>mahilig </em>+ verb. That leaves us with <em>bawal</em>, <em>puwede </em>and <em>huwag</em>.</p>
<h3><ins>Plain Pseudo-verbs with Standard Sentences (SS)</ins></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #00008b;">Plain pseudo verb Sentence. = <strong>Plain pseudo-verb</strong> (+ linker) + SS. </span></h2>
<h5><strong>Notes: Verb takes infinitive. The linker goes before the verb. Use the linker if it is -</strong><strong><em>ng </em></strong><strong>type, but omit it if it is </strong><strong><em>na</em></strong><strong>.</strong></h5>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To form these, take all the enclitics out of the standard sentence and put them after the pseudo-verb, then change the verb to infinitive.</p>

<h3><ins>Samples of Negated Sentences</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Like ng pseudo-verbs, in general plain pseudo-verbs are negated with <em>hindi</em>. But <em>bawal </em>is already a negation of <em>puwede</em>(may), and <em>huwag </em>negates imperative sentences, so they do not take <em>hindi</em>. <em>Hindi puwede</em> will mean “unable” in this book. It can also mean “may not” colloquially, but we will only use <em>bawal </em>for that to be consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><ins>Review: Comparing Ng and Plain Pseudo-Verbs</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Ng </em>and plain pseudo-verb non-AF sentences, and plain pseudo-verb AF sentences, use the same grammar. <em>Ng </em>pseudo-verb AF sentences are different. Unlike the others, in <em>ng </em>pseudo-verb AF sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">It is mandatory to change the actor to <em>ng </em>form.</li>
<li dir="auto">It is preferred to put the actor after the pseudo-verb even when it is not a personal pronoun.</li>
