<h1><span style="color: #ff8748;">Grammar</span></h1>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We introduced <em>sino </em>in one of the first lessons and promised to get deeper, so here we are. <em>Sino </em>is the ang form of “who”. In this lesson we cover sino deeper, and introduce the <em>ng, sa</em> and <em>nasa </em>forms as well.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><ins>Sino</ins></h3>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In general, <em>sino </em>is an alternate for <em>alin </em>that only works with people. We will always use <em>sino </em>when working with people in this book. Here are four common ways that <em>sino </em>is used.&nbsp;</p>
